<h2>Ham Radio</h2>
<p>I'm a licensed ham radio operator since 1996. My call is SM6WJM (and OZ3ALB
  in Denmark).</p>
<p>I'm interested in SDR (Software Defined Radio) and am a contributor to the
  <a href="https://www.gnuradio.org/">GNURadio project</a>. Most of my recent
  work have gone into optimizing GNURadio for ARM CPU based SoC boards, in
  particular Raspberry Pi 3 and 4. You can check the progress of that work
  in this <a href="https://github.com/gnuradio/volk/issues/243">issue</a>.</p>

<h2>Programming</h2>
<p>I've been enjoying programming since QBasic 4.5, released in 1988 which also
  was the last version of QuickBasic. While a horrible language it certainly had
  some merits when learning programming. In particular you didn't have to set up
  an advanced development environment. Since most of
  my code nowadays is related to signal processing it's mostly in C and C++ but
  but I'm also interested in functional programming. Erlang is a very
  interesting language.</p>

<p><pre>Ed is the standard text editor.</pre></p>
<p>I use emacs.</p>

<h2>Medicine</h2>
<p>In my day job I'm an anesthesiologist/intensivist doctor.
I'm particularly interested in the use of technology in medicine.
Current area of research is the use of advanced signal processing algorithms on EEG data.
